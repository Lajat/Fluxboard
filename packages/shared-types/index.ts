/**
 * Shared domain types for fluxboard.
 *
 * Both `apps/web` (Next.js frontend) and `apps/api` (Express backend) import
 * from this package instead of each defining their own copy of these shapes.
 * This is the main reason fluxboard is a monorepo rather than two separate
 * repos: a `Card` on the backend and a `Card` on the frontend are always
 * guaranteed to match, because they're literally the same type definition.
 *
 * If you add a new field to a type here, TypeScript will flag every place
 * in both apps that now needs to handle it — that's the safety net this
 * package buys you.
